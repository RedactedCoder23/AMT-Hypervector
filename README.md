# AMT Hypervector Framework

This repository contains a simple prototype for experimenting with Associative Memory Transformer (AMT) hypervectors. It includes a few core utilities, an LLM adapter, and a small chess plugin that demonstrates self play.

## Quickstart

```bash
pip install -e .
pytest
```

The examples directory contains minimal demos for sentiment analysis and LoRA fine-tuning of a tiny GPT-2 model. These stubs can be expanded into full experiments.
